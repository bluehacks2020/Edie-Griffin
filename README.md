Application Description:
KarTribo is an e-commerce web application, covering what the Indigenous People make/creates that would be sold for a living. They would be profiting from the sales of their creations. Covering one the first reason why they struggle to adjust to the Urban society.

The concept of the app was brought up as an idea that would be developed into a prototype as we thought that it would promote and preserve their culture. That even the ones from the Urban would recognize and would learn about the Indigenous people that we rarely see or hear about.

This prototype was developed into what we could accomplish that would best describe our intentions for the Indigenous People. Promote, preserve and save. Benefits from the sales that would help the Indigenous People better.

The slogan of the KarTribo E-commerce App is YOU buy, WE help.
